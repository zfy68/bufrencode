BUFR Decoding and Encoding Features
This repository implements BUFR decoding and encoding functionalities based on the netCDF-Java source code. Below are the key features of this functionality:

Implementation based on netCDF-Java source code: Leveraging the netCDF-Java library as the foundation, BUFR decoding and encoding features are constructed.
Optimized handling of netCDF-Java parsing errors in GDAS data: Rectified parsing errors encountered during GDAS data parsing, ensuring improved accuracy and reliability.
Rewritten BUFR decoding: The BUFR decoding functionality has been rewritten, encompassing decoding of both compressed and uncompressed data. This ensures robust support and parsing capabilities for various BUFR format data.
Added BUFR encoding functionality: A new BUFR encoding feature has been introduced, currently supporting encoding of uncompressed data, with future support planned for compressed data encoding.
